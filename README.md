## Features
- Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to analyze patient-provided text inputs.
- Classifies conditions into categories like depression, birth control, and acne.
- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed to ensure high-quality insights.
- Built using state-of-the-art NLP tools and techniques.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

- **Conditions Count Analysis**: A visualization showcasing the distribution of different patient conditions, helping identify the most and least common categories.
